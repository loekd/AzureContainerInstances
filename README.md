# AzureContainerInstances

Demo for Azure Container Instances with multiple containers cooperating.

**At this time, it's not possible to run multiple Windows containers in one group.**

Hopefully it will be, in the future.

While we wait, please go to [AzureContainerInstancesLinux](https://github.com/loekd/AzureContainerInstancesLinux) to see how it works on Linux.
